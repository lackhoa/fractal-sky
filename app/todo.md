- Draw the y-axis to point up
- Draw the frame boundary
- We need menu
- Add a "center" menu button, so that user will go back to land after zooming or drawing too much
- Add UI for zoom
- Add a background area, so users know what's going on
- Add copy/paste
- Change properties like "stroke", "stroke-width" and "fill": go for the side-panel first, before drop-down context menu
- Try the compositional transform again
- Axes somehow must have a consistent relation to shapes
