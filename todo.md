- We need infinite grid
- Calculate the svg size so that it fits
- Add a background area, so users know what's going on
- Add triangles
- Add copy/paste
- Change properties like "stroke", "stroke-width" and "fill": go for the side-panel first, before drop-down context menu
- Menu to turn off grid & axes
- Remove box highlight for focused shapes, for filling
- Try the compositional transform again
- Axes somehow must have a consistent relation to shapes
