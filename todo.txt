- I need a model of focused control
- Implement the old controls
- Allow changing levels arbitrarily
- Add "send-to-front/back"
- Change properties like stroke, stroke-width and fill: go for the side-panel first, before drop-down context menu
- Add copy/paste
- Turn off grid & axes
- Allow flipping

? Remove box highlight for focused shapes
