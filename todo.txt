- Changing tree depth arbitrarily
+ add control for that
- We need infinite grid
- Add triangles
- Add copy/paste
- Change properties like "stroke", "stroke-width" and "fill": go for the side-panel first, before drop-down context menu
- Send shapes to front/back
+ We really gotta design for this!
+ Use "el.insertAdjacentHTML("afterend")" or "insertBefore(el)"
+ But what about echos, though?
- Menu to turn off grid & axes

? Remove box highlight for focused shapes
