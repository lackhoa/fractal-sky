- Changing tree depth arbitrarily
+ add control for that
- We need infinite grid
- Add triangles
- Add copy/paste
- Change properties like "stroke", "stroke-width" and "fill": go for the side-panel first, before drop-down context menu
- Menu to turn off grid & axes

- Send shapes to front/back
-- Controls have to be affected, too
-- There is a strict axes
-- Use "el.insertAdjacentHTML("afterend")" or "insertBefore(el)"
-- But what about echos, though? We do store the parents so maybe that's fine
-- How do we store and restore this relation? When new elements are created: where are they supposed to be?
-- Maybe we infer this ordering from the shape list itself?
-- So we do this, get the nearest previous element that is still active, insert after it


? Remove box highlight for focused shapes
